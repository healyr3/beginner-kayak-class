    <h4><strong>Base Layers for Pacific Northwest Paddling:</strong> Staying Warm in the Wild</h4>
    <p>Welcome to the world of whitewater kayaking in the Pacific Northwest! As you gear up for your first adventure, remember, staying warm and dry is key to enjoying your time on the river. That's where your base layer comes in – the crucial first line of defense against chilly waters and unpredictable weather.</p>
    <p>Forget cotton! Pacific Northwest rivers are notorious for their brisk temperatures, and cotton soaks up water like a sponge, leaving you feeling clammy and cold. Instead, opt for synthetic or wool base layers. These fabrics wick moisture away from your skin, keeping you dry and comfortable even when you take a dip.</p>
    <p>Synthetic base layers like polyester or nylon are lightweight, dry quickly, and are generally more affordable. They're a great choice for warmer days or if you tend to run hot.</p>
    <p>Wool base layers are naturally insulating, even when wet, making them ideal for colder weather paddling. They're also odor-resistant and have a luxurious feel against your skin. However, wool can be pricier and takes longer to dry.</p>
    <p>Choosing the right weight is also important. For summer paddling in the Pacific Northwest, a lightweight or midweight base layer will suffice. But as the temperatures drop, you'll want to graduate to a heavier weight base layer to stay toasty.</p>
    <p>Fit is key! Your base layer should fit snugly without being restrictive. Avoid baggy clothes that can chafe or trap water. A good rule of thumb is to be able to move freely and comfortably in your base layer.</p>
    <p>Bonus tip: Pack an extra base layer, just in case! Spills happen, and having a dry change can make a world of difference in your paddling experience.</p>
    <p>Remember, layering is your friend in Pacific Northwest kayaking. Start with a good base layer, and add or remove outer layers as the conditions change. With the right gear and a bit of know-how, you'll be paddling warm and dry all season long!</p>
    <p>Now that you know the basics of baselayers for whitewater kayaking, please read <a href="assets/content/Hypothermia_an_Early_Season_Killer_by_Dr_William_W_Forgey_MD.pdf" target="_blank">"Hypothermia an Early Season Killer"</a> by Dr William W Forgey MD to familiarize yourself for why this is so important.</p>

    <h4><strong>Drysuits for Pacific Northwest Paddling:</strong> Staying Dry in the Wild</h4>
    <p>In the unpredictable Pacific Northwest waters, keeping warm and dry is crucial for enjoying your whitewater adventures.</p>
    <p>Imagine a superhero against water – that's a drysuit. It's a waterproof overall with attached booties and neck and wrist seals, keeping you completely dry even during unplanned swims. Think icy splashes, drenching downpours, even full-on rollovers – a drysuit shrugs them all off.</p>
    <h4><strong>Benefits</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Ultimate dryness: Stay dry even if you take a swim.</li>
        <li>Warmth: Layer up comfortably underneath for insulation.</li>
        <li>Versatility: Great for year-round paddling, from chilly spring to icy winter.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Considerations</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Cost: Drysuits are typically more expensive than other options. Renting is a great option for the class.</li>
        <li>Mobility: Can feel a bit bulky as you get accustomed to it.</li>
        <li>Bathroom breaks: Relief zippers require practice!</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Boats and More</h1>
    <p>In addition to choosing the proper gear to stay warm and dry, getting the proper boat, paddle, and safety gear is crucial for navigating rivers in a safe and enjoyable way.</p>
    <ul>
        <p><li><strong>Kayak:</strong> Choose a whitewater-specific kayak designed for your skill level and the type of river you'll be paddling. The style of kayaks best suited for this course is river runners. Playboats can be fun once you learn the basics of paddling whitewater, but are not a good boat to learn in and cannot be used for this class. If you have any questions on boat styles, reach out to the instructors.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Paddle:</strong> Opt for a durable, lightweight paddle with the right blade size and shaft length for your height and paddling style.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Personal Flotation Device (PFD):</strong> Invest in a Coast Guard-approved Type III PFD that fits snugly and comfortably. It is important to use a whitewater specific PDF as they fit the body well are designed to provide the range of motion necessary in this sport.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Helmet:</strong> A properly fitted helmet protects your head from bumps and scrapes. It is important to use a whitewater specific helmet to protect the forehead. Bike and surf helmets are not allowed for this class.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Spray Skirt:</strong> This essential piece of gear keeps water out of your kayak cockpit during swims and rough rapids. It is important to get a skirt that fits both your torso and the boat.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Kayak Shoes or Booties:</strong> Wear quick-drying footwear with good grip to protect your feet on slippery rocks and riverbeds.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Gloves or Pogies:</strong> Optional, but provide hand protection from cold water and abrasion.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Whistle:</strong> An easy-to-use whistle for signaling for help.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Nose Plug:</strong> A great way to keep water out of your sinuses and increase your comfort on the river.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Dry bag:</strong> Keep essential items like your snacks and spare layers dry.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Snacks:</strong> A great way to get a boost of energy while on the river.</li></p>
    </ul>
    <p>Read the excerpts from the course textbook <a href="assets/content/Classroom_-_referenced_reading_pages.pdf" target="_blank">"Whitewater Kayaking, The Ultimate Guide"</a> to become more familiar with the above topics. We will be covering these topics in more detail during the classroom session.</p>

    <h1>Classroom Tips</h1>
    <ul>
        <p><li>Put your boat in your car or lock it to your roof rack (it will stay outside while we are in
            classroom). Bike locks work, or a cable/chain with a padlock.</li></p>
        <p><li>Be prepared to “get dressed” into kayaking gear in class. We won’t make you put on all your
            base layers because it’s too warm inside, but wear something you can easily slide your drysuit
            over.</li></p>
